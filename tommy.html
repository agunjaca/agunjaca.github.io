          <section>
            I've been on and off the project numerous times becouse Iâ€™ve joined
            locastic when app was already out. I did multiple sites and landing
            pages, designed lot of UX flows and tons of web elements and pages
            for Tommy. I've worked on print for Tommy flyers, billboards,
            marketing campaigns, social media posts etc. I was part of the team
            that won a SoMo award for this project and have also designed and
            co-directed a video for that submission.
